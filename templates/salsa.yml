  ## SALSA 💃 Annotation Instructions  
  Please make sure you select all the edits, some edits **may be easily missed** when the sentence is too long.
  
  If you encounter any bug or have any suggestion on this tool, please write it at this [google doc link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQpOMZij_keFGonBr9ZvXUn4cmgTgfpfueME_bVU-FI/edit).
  
  If you have any question, please don't hesitate to ask us over **slack**.
  
  Have fun!!!
